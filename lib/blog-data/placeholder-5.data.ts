          "title": "Treating Integration as a Technology Project",
          "mistake": "Buying expensive marketing automation platform and expecting integration to happen automatically. Technology alone won't create strategic alignment or coordinate teams.",
          "solution": "Start with strategy and process first. Define what integration means for your business, establish coordination workflows, then select technology that supports your process. GrowthTech used spreadsheets and Slack for their first integrated campaign before investing in automation."

          "title": "Attempting Big Bang Integration",
          "mistake": "Trying to integrate all channels and campaigns at once, overwhelming the team and creating chaos. This usually results in abandoning integration entirely after one quarter.",
          "solution": "Use pilot campaigns to build integration capabilities gradually. Start with 2-3 channels for one campaign, learn what works, document the process, then expand. Build muscle memory before scaling."
        },
        {
          "title": "Ignoring Organizational Barriers",
          "mistake": "Assuming channel owners will naturally coordinate when their incentives, KPIs, and reporting structures are siloed. Social media manager measured on followers, email on open rates, paid on CTR—all optimizing locally, not strategically.",
          "solution": "Align incentives around shared business outcomes. Create cross-functional campaign teams with shared KPIs. At GrowthTech, 50% of every channel owner's bonus is tied to overall marketing ROI, not individual channel metrics."
        },
        {
          "title": "Prioritizing Coordination Over Results",
          "mistake": "Becoming so focused on process and coordination that you lose sight of business outcomes. Endless meetings about integration while actual marketing performance degrades.",
          "solution": "Set clear success metrics for integrated campaigns that are higher than siloed benchmarks. If integration isn't delivering better results within 3 months, reassess your approach. Process should enable performance, not replace it."

        {
          "title": "Neglecting Content Quality for Distribution",
          "mistake": "Creating mediocre content because you're focused on distributing it across multiple channels. Integration amplifies both good and bad content—poor content integrated across 5 channels is worse than good content in one.",
          "solution": "Maintain high content standards while integrating distribution. GrowthTech's rule: 'Never distribute content you wouldn't be proud to have in just one channel.' Quality first, then strategic amplification across integrated channels."
